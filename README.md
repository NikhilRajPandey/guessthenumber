# Guess The Number

A game written in python3, which is a number guessing console game, where we have to guess a number which is randomly choosen by the computer system. The game becomes more interesting as well as infuriating as the user gets limited attempt to guess the attempts. If you run out of attempts, then you loose. Also, on the way of answering the number, the game provides you with hints like your answer is lesser or greater as compared to the original number or not.

## Usage

To use the game (i.e., play the game), follow the below steps :
* _If using windows_, then open the folder where you have saved the "_guessthenumber.py_" file. Then, either double-click the icon of the file, or just open it with IDLE or directly from the windows terminal (Command Prompt, or PowerShell).
* _If using linux_, then open up the terminal. Change the directory into the folder where you have saved the "_guessthenumber.py_" script file using the below specified command. ```cd location/to/the/folder/```.
